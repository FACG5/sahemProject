# sahemProject


### About 
sahem is a platform that links creative youth from Gaza strip who lack the suffecient fund to start their own projects with donors from all around the world.

---

### Problem statement:
The existence of guys with alot of creative and development ideas who lack the required money to fund thier projects while on the other hand, there are alot of people all around the world who are interesting in gaza economy development and are willing to support people with creative ideas.

---

### Our solution:
Creating a website that grants creative people the opportionity to create and present thier ideas globally and be given the chance to be funded while at the same time allow donors who are interested in development in gaza from all around the world to view these projects, search with their criteria of interest and fund their desirable projects.
